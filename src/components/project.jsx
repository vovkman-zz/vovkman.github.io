Outside of pure development my responsibilities includ developing a deep understanding of website build and delivery process in order to optimize user experience on slow networks, and the technical implementation of Google Analytics to conform with RBC security standards for RBC Ventures apps hosted in the cloud. My role with GA has given me the opportunity to work extensively with product, marketing, design, and internal RBC teams, giving me a well rounded view of what it takes to convert users into paying customers, as well as how to manage integrations between RBC Ventures cloud and internal RBC.",
